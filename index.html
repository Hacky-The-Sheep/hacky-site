        My name is Jon.
        <br />
        I currently work as a Data Manager, and like to program and learn
        things on the side as a hobby.
        <br />
        I'm currently learning rust ðŸ¦€, and looking to build CLI programs for
        fun.

    <h2>No JS?</h2>
    <p>
      The source code isn't up yet, but when it is you will find no JS
      anywhere in the source files.
      <br />
      This isn't because I don't or can't learn javascript, but more about the
      philosophy of the web, and what actually needs to go on a site for it to
      be <i>functional</i>.
