        My name is Jon. I currently work as a Data Manager, and like to program and learn
        things on the side as a hobby.
        <br />
        I'm currently learning rust ðŸ¦€, and looking to build CLI programs for
        fun.

    <h2>No JS?</h2>

    <p>
      The source code isn't up yet, but when it is you will find no JS anywhere in the source files. This isn't because
      I don't or can't learn javascript, but more about the
      philosophy of the web, and what actually needs to go on a site for it to be <i>functional</i>.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>What does this mean?</b>
    </p>

    <p>
      The modern web is bloated, with exploits from JS being found regularly. But security notwithstanding, the question
      to be asked is "what is the purpose of the web"? Although the websites are prettier, I don't find such fluff to be
      necessary and may be detrminental to the human psyche. Each layer of complexity and eye candy does not
      satisfy, but merely leads to a desire for more and more such pleasures. The <a
        href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/">mo**erf***ing website</a>, is a good (although crude) example of getting
      the point
      across without overdesigning the page. Let the content speak for itself, but perhaps not to the extreme of the
      prior example.
    </p>

    <p>
      Of course, a site doesn't necessarily have to be <i>that</i> simple. CSS and colors are wonderful for focusing the
      eyes to the proper content (this site for example). The web and our emphasis should be the content alone, and less
      bloat.
